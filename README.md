## Overview

- Briefly explain what the repo is, what the point/purpose of the repo is and key features

## Documentation

- Link to where any relevant docs are stored

## Publishing

Here is a checklist of actions to complete before making a repository public. Make sure you follow the instructions below and that you double check with the latest checklist stored [here](https://github.com/livewyer-ops/internal-docs/blob/master/processes/making-a-repo-public).

### Required

- Create comprehensive README, with [LW banner](/processes/making-a-repo-public/github-banner.png)
- Update `\\repo_name\\` with your repo name in [PR](/.github/pull_request_template.md) Template and `Contributing` section of this README
- Set the repo description and tags
- Add [LICENCE](./LICENSE)
- Add [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- Remove all sensitive data ([gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) to find it, [git-filter-repo](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo) to remove it from the history, GitHub guide, PR deletion)
- Remove inactive branches so remaining branches are clear and tidy
- Create a GitHub [ruleset](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/about-rulesets) to protect the main branch:
  - Restrict deletions
  - Require linear history
  - Require signed commits
  - Require a pull request before merge
    - Require approvals
    - Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
    - Require review from Code Owners
    - Require conversation resolution before merging
  - Require status checks to pass before merge
  - Block force pushes
- Decide who will maintain the public repo

### Optional

- Add Contributing guide (can be added to the README, see example repo)
- Add [Git Issue](/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.yaml)/[PR](/.github/pull_request_template.md) Templates
- [Squash commits](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/configuring-commit-squashing-for-pull-requests) by default
- Add OWNERS/[CODEOWNERS](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners) file
- Set [PR limits](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/managing-pull-request-reviews-in-your-repository) to avoid spamming
